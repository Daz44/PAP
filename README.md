Planned Implementations
-----------------------
```
calc_speed   - Calculate speed, acceleration and distance based of of Force, Mass and Speed
calc_acel    - Calculates acceleration based off of Force and Mass
calc_weight  - Calculates weight based of Acceleration and Force
calc_force   - Calculates force based off of Acceleration and Mass

```
Commands
-----------------------
```
test                      - Test Speed Calculation.
testlong                  - Long Test Calculation.
calcs_speed                 - Calculates speed, distance and acceleration over time.
convert-ms/km             - Converts m/s to km/h.
convert-km/ms             - Converts km/h to m/s.
```
